#### Note: we now enable the usage of `rustls-tls` and the `bundled-sqlite` features in the 2  ####
####       matrix crate dependencies, so the below android- and windows-specific dependencies  ####
####       are no longer needed. However, if you wish to disable those features, you would     ####
####       need to re-enable the below target-specific dependencies.                           ####

## On Android, we currently build OpenSSL and SQLite from
## the vendored source code, because on macOS hosts there aren't yet
## prebuilt versions readily available, nor easily-configured pkg-config sysroots
## like there are on Linux.
##
## Even though we don't directly depend on these crates in Robrix,
## specifying them here with the `vendored`/`bundled` features
## will cause cargo to enable those features across the entire build
## (called "feature unification", see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification),
## meaning that any other crate that depends on them will also use the vendored versions.
##
## Technically, we don't need these when building for Android on Linux systems,
## but there's no way to specify that in Cargo.toml, so we just always include them.
## Plus, this makes builds more reproducible across host systems,
## and avoids the issue of needing to set up pkg-config sysroots on Linux.
##
# [target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
# openssl = { version = "*", features = ["vendored"] }
# rusqlite = { version = "*", features = ["bundled"] }

## On Windows, there are prebuilt versions of sqlite3 available,
## but building it from bundled source is just easier and works out of the box.
##
## If you don't want to include sqlite3 as a static library built from source,
## you can comment out the below lines and link against a prebuilt version.
## One way to easily do this is to install sqlite using a package manager like `chocolatey`
## (see <https://stackoverflow.com/a/76427629>). Another way is to or download it
## directly from the sqlite website: <https://www.sqlite.org/download.html>,
## where you'll want the 64-bit DLL (x64) under "Precompiled Binaries for Windows".
## You'll need to add the directory of that prebuilt sqlite DLL to your path env variable.

Robrix is a multi-platform Matrix chat client written in pure Rust
using the Makepad UI framework (https://github.com/makepad/makepad)

(https://github.com/project-robius).
Robrix runs on all major desktop and mobile platforms:
macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## The below command uses cargo-metadata to determine the path of the `makepad_widgets` crate on the host build system,
## and copies the `makepad-widgets/resources` directory to the `./dist/resources/makepad_widgets` directory.
## We also copy the Robrix project's `resources/` directory to the `./dist/resources/robrix` directory.
##
## This is necessary because the `cargo packager` command only supports defining resources at a known path
## (see the below `resources = [...]` block below),
## so we need to copy the resources to a known fixed (static) path before packaging,
## such that cargo-packager can locate them and include them in the final package.

## We then build the entire Robrix project and set the `MAKEPAD_PACKAGE_DIR` env var to the proper value.
## * For macOS app bundles, this should be set to `.` because we set the `apple_bundle` cfg option
##   for Makepad, which causes Makepad to look for resources in the `Contents/Resources/` directory,
##   which is where the resources are located for an Apple app bundle (`.app` and `.dmg`).
## * For Debian `.deb` packages, this should be set to `/usr/lib/<main-binary-name>`,
##   which is currently `/usr/lib/robrix`.
##   This is the directory in which `dpkg` copies app resource files to when installing the `.deb` package.
##   * On Linux, we also strip the binaries of unneeded content, as required for Debian packages.
##   * For Debian and Pacman (still a to-do!) packages, we also auto-generate the list of dependencies required by Robrix.
