## On Android, we currently build OpenSSL and SQLite from
## the vendored source code, because on macOS hosts there aren't yet
## prebuilt versions readily available, nor easily-configured pkg-config sysroots
## like there are on Linux.
##
## Even though we don't directly depend on these crates in Robrix,
## specifying them here with the `vendored`/`bundled` features
## will cause cargo to enable those features across the entire build
## (called "feature unification", see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification),
## meaning that any other crate that depends on them will also use the vendored versions.
##
## Technically, we don't need these when building for Android on Linux systems,
## but there's no way to specify that in Cargo.toml, so we just always include them.
## Plus, this makes builds more reproducible across host systems,
## and avoids the issue of needing to set up pkg-config sysroots on Linux.
