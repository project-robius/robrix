//! The RoomsSideBar is the widget that contains the RoomsList and other items.
//!
//! It differs in what content it includes based on the adaptive view:
//! * On a narrow mobile view, it acts as the root_view of StackNavigation
//!   * It includes a title label, a search bar, and the RoomsList.
//! * On a wide desktop view, it acts as a permanent tab that is on the left side of the dock.
//!   * It only includes a title label and the RoomsList, because the SearcBar
//!     is at the top of the HomeScreen in Desktop view.
