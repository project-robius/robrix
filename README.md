Robrix is a Matrix chat client written in Rust to demonstrate the functionality of [Project Robius](https://github.com/project-robius), a framework for multi-platform application development in Rust.

> ⚠️ Robrix is a work-in-progress that doesn't yet support all Matrix chat features.
>
> Note that only the first "Rooms" tab of the UI is in use.

The following table shows which host systems can currently be used to build Robrix for which target platforms.
| Host OS | Target Platform | Builds? | Runs? |
| ------- | --------------- | ------- | ----- |
| macOS   | macOS           | ✅      | ✅    |
| macOS   | Android         | ✅      | ✅    |
| macOS   | iOS             | ✅      | ✅    |
| Linux   | Linux           | ✅      | ✅    |
| Linux   | Android         | ✅      | ✅    |
| Windows | Windows         | ✅      | ✅    |
| Windows | Android         | ✅      | ✅    |



## Building and Running

First, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, install the required native libraries. For example, on Linux:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev
```

Then, on a standard desktop platform (macOS, Linux, Windows), simply run:
```sh
cargo run -- 'USERNAME' 'PASSWORD' ['HOMESERVER_URL']
```

* Robrix only supports a standard username + password login currently.
    * Note the usage of **single quotes** (not double quotes), which will prevent your shell from treating certain symbols as globs/regex patterns.
    * If you created your Matrix account using a third-party Single Sign On (SSO) like a Google account, you can set a standard password by using [Element's password reset form](https://app.element.io/#/forgot_password).
* The `HOMESERVER_URL` argument is optional and uses the `"https://matrix-client.matrix.org/"` URL by default.


### Building Robrix for Android

1. Install the `cargo-makepad` build tool:
   ```sh
   cargo install --force --git https://github.com/makepad/makepad.git --branch rik cargo-makepad
   ```

2. Use `cargo-makepad` to install the Android toolchain, with the full NDK:
   ```sh
   cargo makepad android install-toolchain --full-ndk
   ```

3. Build and run Robrix using `cargo-makepad`:
    * Fill in your username and password in the [`login.toml`](login.toml) file.
    * Then use cargo makepad to build and run:
       ```sh
       cargo makepad android run -p robrix --release
       ```
    * You'll need to connect a physical Android device with developer options enabled, or start up an emulator using Android Studio.
        * API version 33 or higher is required, which is Android 13 and up.

## Known problems/issues
 - URLs do not wrap properly; that is a Makepad-side problem.
 - Matrix-specific links are not yet fully handled (https://matrix.to/...)
 - Ignoring/unignoring a user clears all timelines  (see: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1703); the timeline will be re-filled using gradual pagination, but the viewport is not maintained
