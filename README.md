Robrix is a Matrix chat client written in Rust to demonstrate the functionality of [Project Robius](https://github.com/project-robius), a framework for multi-platform application development in Rust. Robrix is written using the [Makepad UI toolkit](https://github.com/makepad/makepad/).

## Building and Running

1. First, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. If you're building on **Linux** or **WSL** on Windows, install the required dependencies. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.
   * `openssl`, `clang`/`libclang`, `binfmt`, `Xcursor`/`X11`, `asound`/`pulse`.

   On a Debian-like Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu), run the following:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config binfmt-support libxcursor-dev libx11-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev
   ```

3. Then, build and run Robrix (you can optionally add `--release`):
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```
   If you want to provide a username and password for fast auto-login, you can do that on the command line like so. Note that you only have to specify this once; after one successful login, Robrix will automatically re-login the most recent user without having to specify the user's ID or password.
   ```sh
   cargo run -- 'USERNAME' 'PASSWORD' ['HOMESERVER_URL']
   ```
    * Note that if you enter your password on the command line, you should wrap it in **single quotes** (not double quotes) in order to prevent your shell from treating certain symbols as globs/regex patterns.
    * The `HOMESERVER_URL` argument is optional and uses the `"https://matrix-client.matrix.org/"` URL by default.
    * The Matrix homeserver must support Sliding Sync, the same requirement as Element X.


### Building Robrix for Android

1. Install the `cargo-makepad` build tool:
   ```sh
   cargo install --force --git https://github.com/makepad/makepad.git --branch rik cargo-makepad
   ```

2. Use `cargo-makepad` to install the Android toolchain, with the full NDK:
   ```sh
   cargo makepad android install-toolchain --full-ndk
   ```

3. Build and run Robrix using `cargo-makepad`:
   ```sh
   cargo makepad android run -p robrix --release
   ```
    * You'll need to connect a physical Android device with developer options enabled, or start up an emulator using Android Studio.
        * API version 33 or higher is required, which is Android 13 and up.

## Known problems/issues
 - Matrix-specific links are not yet fully handled (https://matrix.to/...)
 - Ignoring/unignoring a user clears all timelines  (see: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1703); the timeline will be re-filled using gradual pagination, but the viewport position is not maintained


## Packaging Robrix for Distribution on Desktop Platforms

> [!TIP]
> We already have [pre-built releases of Robrix](https://github.com/project-robius/robrix/releases) available for download.


1. Install `cargo-packager`:
```sh
rustup update stable  ## Rust version 1.79 or higher is required
cargo +stable install --force --locked cargo-packager
```
For posterity, these instructions have been tested on `cargo-packager` version 0.10.1, which requires Rust v1.79.

2. Install the `robius-packaging-commands` crate with the `makepad` feature enabled:
```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/project-robius/robius-packaging-commands.git
```

3. Then run the packaging command, which must build in release mode:
```sh
cargo packager --release ## --verbose is optional
```


### Platform-specific considerations
Note that due to platform restrictions, you can currently only build:
* Linux packages on a Linux OS machine
* Windows installer executables on a Windows OS machine
* macOS disk images / app bundles on a macOS machine
* iOS apps on a macOS machine.
* Android, on a machine with any OS!

There are some additional considerations when packaging Robrix for macOS:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will see a .dmg window pop up — please leave it alone, it will auto-close once the packaging procedure has completed.

> [!TIP]
> If you receive the following error:
>
> ```
> ERROR cargo_packager::cli: Error running create-dmg script: File exists (os error 17)
> ```
>
> then open Finder and unmount any Robrix-related disk images, then try the above `cargo packager` command again.

> [!TIP]
> If you receive an error like so:
>
> ```
> Creating disk image...
> hdiutil: create failed - Operation not permitted
> could not access /Volumes/Robrix/Robrix.app - Operation not permitted
> ```
>
> then you need to grant "App Management" permissions to the app in which you ran the `cargo packager` command, e.g., Terminal, Visual Studio Code, etc.
> To do this, open `System Preferences` → `Privacy & Security` → `App Management`,
> and then click the toggle switch next to the relevant app to enable that permission.
> Then, try the above `cargo packager` command again.

After the command completes, you should see both the `Robrix.app` and the `.dmg` in the `dist/` directory.
You can immediately double-click the `Robrix.app` bundle to run it, or you can double-click the `.dmg` file to

> Note that the `.dmg` is what should be distributed for installation on other machines, not the `.app`.

If you'd like to modify the .dmg background, here is the [Google Drawings file used to generate the MacOS .dmg background image](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/10ALUgNV7v-4bRTIE5Wb2vNyXpl2Gj3YJcl7Q2AGpvDw/edit?usp=sharing).
